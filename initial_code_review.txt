Here’s a quick code‐review of your current game.py. Overall it’s a solid, minimal Pygame “Space Invaders”
    prototype—everything you need is in place (player, bullets, enemies, collision, win/lose, restart). A few thoughts
    and suggestions for improvement:

        1. Structure & Organization
           • Right now everything lives in a single script and the main loop is at module‐scope. Consider splitting
    into:
             – A `main()` function (so imports don’t execute on import)
             – Separate modules or classes for “Game” (handles states), “Level” (enemy formation/movement), etc.
           • Group your event–update–draw logic into functions (`handle_events()`, `update(dt)`, `draw()`) for clarity
    and easier testing.
        2. Frame‐rate independence
           • You pass `dt` (milliseconds) into `update()`, but you never actually use it. This means your motion scales
    with framerate, which can vary.
             – Option A: Scale your speeds by `dt`, e.g.
           ```python
           self.rect.x += PLAYER_SPEED * (dt/1000)
           ```
             – Option B: Keep “pixels per frame” but remove `dt` parameter so it’s clear you’re frame‐driven.
        3. Magic numbers & configuration
           • You already have nice constants at top (WIDTH, FPS, etc.). I’d extract color strings into constants too,
    e.g.

               COLOR_BG = (0,0,0); COLOR_PLAYER = (255,255,255)

            —even if you later load surfaces, you’ll have one place to tweak palette.
           • Likewise, your enemy spacing, margins and reload delays could be in a small config or defaults section.
        4. Game state & restart
           • You’re using module‐level globals (`score`, `game_over`, etc.). As you add more states it can get unwieldy.

             – You might bundle game state into a `Game` class with methods like `reset()`, `update()`, `draw()`.
             – That will also make it easier to add menus, multiple levels, high‐score screens, etc.
        5. Enemy block movement
           • You currently move each enemy one by one, check bounds, then “descend” the whole block. This is fine for
    small grids, but for larger formations you may want to track the bounding‐rect of your enemy group so you only ever
    adjust once:

               bounds = enemies.sprites_rect_union()
               if bounds.right >= WIDTH-10 or bounds.left <= 10:
                  enemy_direction *= -1
                  for e in enemies: e.rect.y += ENEMY_DROP

           • (Helper methods exist or you can compute min/max x from the group.)
        6. Gameplay enhancements
           • Limit number of on‐screen bullets (classic Space Invaders only allows one at a time).
           • Give the player multiple lives and display them.
           • Add simple shields/barriers between player and enemies.
           • Load sprite images and sound effects for shooting, explosions, invader steps, etc.
           • Add a “bonus UFO” that flies across the top.
           • Introduce multiple levels with increasing speed, different formations or enemy types.
        7. Collision & scoring
           • You use `groupcollide(enemies, bullets, True, True)`. If you later allow shields or other bullet‐targets,
    you may want finer control over what gets destroyed.
           • Consider giving each row a different point value (bottom row = 10, next = 20, …) to match the arcade.
        8. Small housekeeping
           • You do `pygame.init()` at top; if you pull logic into functions make sure to call it just once from
    `main()`.
           • You call `pygame.font.SysFont(None, 36)`—if you bundle assets later, you can swap in a pixel‐font easily.
           • Handle window resize if you ever want a scalable playfield.

    Next steps really depend on what shape you want the game to take. Let me know which areas you’d like to tackle
    first—refactoring for structure, adding images & sounds, introducing new game mechanics, polishing collision &
    scoring—and we can lay out a plan (and start applying patches).
