    Here’s an updated status now that you’ve refactored into a Game class and pulled your main
    loop & I/O into main() (point 1 is done). Remaining items from the original review:

    – 2. ✅ Done:Frame‐rate independence
      • You still pass dt into update() and into each sprite’s update(dt), but don’t actually use
     it.
      • You have two paths forward:
        – Scale your per‐frame speeds by dt/1000 (i.e. treat your *_SPEED constants as
    “px / sec”), or
        – Remove dt entirely (call group.update() with no args) and document that movement is
    “pixels per frame.”

    – 3. Magic numbers & configuration
      • In create_enemies() you hard‐code margin_x, margin_y, spacing_x, spacing_y.
      • You still sprinkle color strings like "black"/"white"/"yellow"/etc. directly in drawing.
      • Suggest pulling all of these into config.py (or a small constants module) so there’s one
    canonical place for tweaked values.

    – 4. Game state & restart
      • ✅ Done: you moved globals into self.score, self.game_over, and now have a reset() on
    Game.
      • ✅ Done:If you plan more states (menus, high‐score screen, multiple levels), you might expand the
     state machine inside Game.

    – 5. Enemy block movement
      • You currently iterate each enemy, shift it and test for edges, then do a second loop to
    descend.
      • For small ROWS×COLS this is fine; if you grow the formation you could compute the group’s
     bounding‐rect once and branch on that.

    – 6. Gameplay enhancements
      • Still classic “infinite bullets” and a single–shot reload delay.  If you want the
    original feel you could
        – enforce max 1 bullet on screen at once,
        – add player lives, shields, a bonus UFO, sound & art assets, or multi‑level logic.

    – 7. Collision & scoring
      • You award a flat 10 pts per kill.  If you’d like more arcade‐authentic scoring you could
    give each row its own point value or introduce special “shield” sprites that only absorb
    bullets.

    – 8. Small housekeeping
      • You call pygame.init() in __init__() (that’s fine) but if you split asset‐loading you’ll
    want to be sure it only runs once.
      • You’re using pygame.font.SysFont(None, 36) and hard‐coded window size—later you may want
    to swap to a pixel font or a resizable mode.

    — Next steps —
    Which of these shall we tackle next?  For example:

    • Implement true frame‑rate–independent movement (point 2)
    • Pull out all your magic numbers & colors into config.py (point 3)
    • Add a lives counter & cap bullets on screen (point 6)
    • Refine scoring by row or add sound/art assets (points 6/7)

    Let me know which area you’d like to dive into, and I can start drafting patches
